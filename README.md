Summary
LasustechLMS is a web-based Single Page Application (SPA) designed to digitize the library operations of Lagos State University of Science and Technology. It serves two distinct user groups: Students and Librarians. The application facilitates the searching, borrowing, returning, and management of library resources through a responsive, user-friendly interface.

Unlike traditional systems requiring complex backend setups, this application utilizes Browser LocalStorage for data persistence, making it lightweight, portable, and easy to deploy without server-side dependencies.
